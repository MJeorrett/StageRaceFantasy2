# Stage Race Fantasy
An app for running fantasy cycling stage races.

## Broad idea
- Riders are assigned a points value
- Players pick teams of riders within a points budget
- Each stage riders gain points for the various classifications e.g. stage win, yellow jersey and categorised climbs
- The player with the highest combined total for their riders at the end wins!

NOTE: This is take two of [StageRaceFantasy](https://github.com/MJeorrett/StageRaceFantasy).
This time I am using React instead of Blazor as I am more failiar with it and hope to get something working in time for the 2021 TDF.
